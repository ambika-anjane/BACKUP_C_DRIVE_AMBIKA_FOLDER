2. updates in sales_invoice_line_f
3. updates in sales_demand_f (integration_id) how to take
4. which table is the source table

select
    integration_id as unique_field,
    count(*) as n_records

from dev_edw.edw_omni.w_sales_demand_f
where integration_id is not null
group by integration_id

select count(*) from dev_edw.edw_omni.w_sales_demand_f
select count(*) from   dev_discover.ORDER_MGMT.stg_oracle__order_headers
