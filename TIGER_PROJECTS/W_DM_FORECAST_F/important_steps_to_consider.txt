steps in handling facts table 
1. get the staging in the same order as sde
2. first check the joins and where , and
3. first take the inner joins (where and ) then come to the left outer join
4. vice versa
5. complete the staging or final (whatever the sde it is )
6. sometimes we need to derive load from staging having mutilple sources
7. check joins , and's from primary table
8. frst do integration (uniqueness test) and then go for updation and insertion incremntal test
9. for uniqeness (first check uniqueness sql with integration id in target, three cols considered 
for integrtion from source grou by it ) and find any duplication

10 if so,take  first row with primary key value and check whether it is appearing more than once)
11. if ure not able to understand the diffrence in rows 
12. then go for distinct * from the source query
13. then u will get the diffrence in the columb value among those duplicate rows
14. remove the column that is creating duplication and repeat unique test
15. once the unique test goes good ..it wil be good for u (update and insert) test
